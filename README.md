This repository contains the code for the functional direct sampling implemented in R. The two folders contains codes for the two scenarios considered in the "Functional Multiple-Point Simulation" Manuscript:

- Creating copies of an existing functional random field (using the functional random field as a training grid)
- Gap-filling of a missing locations in a functional random field
